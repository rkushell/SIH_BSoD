## AI-Powered Smart Allocation Engine for PM Internship Scheme

The PM Internship Scheme provides students valuable industry exposure, but current allocation methods face challenges of scale, fairness, and transparency. With thousands of applicants and multiple affirmative action goals, manual or semi-automated matching often leads to delays, suboptimal placements, and a low acceptance rate ($\sim 6\%$ as reported by The Hindu). To address this, we propose an AI-powered smart allocation engine with integrated stakeholder portals, ensuring efficiency, fairness, and trust.

Our solution is a three-way portal system supported by a hybrid rule + AI/ML backend allocation engine. Diving into the different Portals: The **Student Portal** ensures secure verification via DigiLocker, allows comprehensive profile setup (academic records, certified skills, project experiences), enables preference management (selecting a limited list of eligible opportunities), and provides real-time tracking of application progress and outcomes. The **Employer Portal** facilitates posting opportunities compliant with scheme rules, offers real-time monitoring of dynamically matched candidates, and provides a feedback loop for viewing allocation status and candidate alignment insights. Finally, the **Government/Admin Portal** provides essential oversight and transparency through dashboards, allows policymakers to tune allocation outcomes using **Policy-as-Code Sliders** (e.g., $35\%$ women representation, SC/ST/OBC quotas, regional balance), and includes compliance controls for blacklisting non-compliant offers, enforcing capacity, and maintaining audit logs.

The backend allocation engine integrates rule-based eligibility checks with dynamic AI/ML scoring and ranking. This includes **Candidate Scoring**, which is weighted across academics ($\sim 40\%$), certified skills ($\sim 35\%$), and projects/experience ($\sim 25\%$), and is tuned for specific employer requirements. **Dynamic Ranking** matches candidates to opportunities based on skill alignment, preferences, and location feasibility. We implement **Company Prioritization** to prevent monopolization and employ **Preference-Aware Rounds** where unplaced candidates are dynamically re-scored for their next preference, minimizing rejection-driven “job bubbles” (vacancies considered filled despite candidate rejection). Crucially, **Fairness-Aware Re-Ranking** ensures compliance with government quotas and representation policies. The entire architecture is **Scalable Architecture** cloud-native, utilizing batch allocation and load balancing, while security is ensured through **Security & Privacy** mechanisms like role-based access control, encryption, and restricted use of sensitive attributes.

Our Tech Stack is robust and modular. **Python with Django** handles the AI/ML scoring and fairness models, while **Java/Spring Boot** ensures scalable backend services. **React/Angular with Node.js** provide fast, interactive portals. **SQL** ensures secure, structured data storage with auditability, and cloud deployment enables scalability for nationwide rollouts. We will mitigate risks by training models initially on synthetic data with adapters for later integration with real scheme datasets (**Dataset Access**), displaying trade-off metrics on admin dashboards with sliders for policy tuning to balance **Fairness vs Accuracy**, ensuring smooth functioning under high application numbers via **Scalability** distributed design, and building trust through full audit trails and explainable allocation reasoning (**Transparency**). The **Impact & Benefits** are significant: Students gain equitable, preference-aware placements with higher acceptance rates; Employers benefit from better skill-role alignment and reduced manual triage; and the Government achieves adjustable, policy-driven controls, transparent auditability, and increased efficiency and equitable representation, leading to greater societal trust and inclusion of underrepresented groups.
